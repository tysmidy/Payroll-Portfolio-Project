9/6/25 - got design/arch in place. Make logic for program. Tomorrow will input what I have and build it out further. MAKE SURE TO MAKE A TICKET FOR THIS

9/8/25 got basic file structure & logic in first commit. Had to go back and install some dependicies for Mongo and express.
9/8/25 Have an issue with tax strat, key is resulting in a TS error. Need to build out data mapping and pass those rates into ts
    -got this fixed. Had to require it. Testing sucks so may see if I can turn alot of this into JS. Unsure on why I chose TS...
Next steps:
-have to build out data mappings
-see about actually getting a DB up so we can pass data in and out of logic  

9/9/25
    -Created very crude data mapping and DB collection. Not sure if I should wait to plan it out or do it now..
    -Was having issues with everthing running, had to get all my ts configs and packages good.
    -Now because of root - package.json, TS will actually complile and run
    Next steps : think I need to get an interface up so you can actually pass data in. From there I can test on basic logic and start building some stuff out.
